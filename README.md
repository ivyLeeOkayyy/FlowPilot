# FlowPilot

FlowPilot is a lightweight AI-assisted automation builder created as a hackathon demo.

Users describe an automation in plain English, and FlowPilot converts that intent into a structured workflow, validates the generated flow, explains it in plain language, and allows the user to run a mock execution before using it.

Example:

> When a new customer contacts us, ask whether they need sales, support, or order help. Route sales inquiries to the sales team, send support users a help article, and ask order users for their order ID.

FlowPilot will:

1. generate a structured automation flow;
2. validate the flow and highlight risky or broken paths;
3. explain the automation in plain English;
4. run a mock conversation through the flow;
5. suggest fixes and test cases when problems are found.

---

## Problem

Creating automation workflows manually requires users to translate business intent into nodes, branches, conditions, and routing rules.

That process is error-prone because a flow may contain:

- unreachable nodes;
- missing fallback branches;
- invalid node references;
- unsafe API calls;
- loops without limits;
- routes that never reach a terminal action;
- missing handling for unexpected user input.

FlowPilot reduces that friction by converting natural-language intent into a concrete workflow artifact and reviewing it before execution.

## MVP Scope

The prototype intentionally prioritizes a small, working backend over a broad visual builder.

### Included

- Natural-language automation input
- Structured workflow generation
- JSON flow artifact
- Deterministic validation
- Plain-English explanation
- Mock conversation execution
- Agent-generated review suggestions
- Agent-generated test cases
- In-memory storage
- Basic execution logs and trace IDs
- Interactive API documentation through FastAPI

### Supported node types

- `trigger`
- `send_message`
- `ask_question`
- `condition`
- `api_call`
- `assign_to_team`
- `wait`
- `end`

### Out of scope

- Real messaging platform integration
- Authentication and multi-tenancy
- Persistent database storage
- Production-grade prompt management
- Full drag-and-drop graph editing
- Real external API execution
- Human approval workflows
- Deployment infrastructure

Describe -> Generate -> Validate -> Explain -> Simulate

## Example Prompts

### Lead qualification

> When a new contact messages us, ask whether they are a buyer or seller. Route buyers to the sales team and send sellers a help article.

### Support triage

> When a customer asks for help, ask whether the issue is billing, account access, or something else. Send billing questions to finance, account access issues to support, and route unknown issues to a human agent.

### Order status

> When a customer asks about an order, ask for the order ID, call the order status API, send the result, and route the conversation to support if the API fails.

## Architecture

        |
        v
FastAPI API Layer
        |
        +--> Flow Generation Service
        +--> Flow Validation Service
        +--> Flow Explanation Service
        +--> Flow Simulation Engine
        +--> Test Case Generation Service
        +--> In-Memory Repository
```

### Main components

- **Flow Generation Service**: converts plain-English intent into a typed workflow.
- **Validation Service**: performs deterministic schema and graph checks.
- **Explanation Service**: describes the workflow in plain language.
- **Simulation Engine**: executes nodes with mock user input and mock API responses.
- **Test Generation Service**: proposes happy-path, fallback, and failure-path tests.
- **In-Memory Repository**: stores flows for the lifetime of the application process.

## Proposed Technology

- Python 3.12+
- FastAPI
- Pydantic v2
- Uvicorn
- Pytest
- Structured JSON logging
- Optional LLM provider integration

---

## Quality and Safety

The application will validate:

- unique node IDs;
- valid trigger nodes;
- valid transition targets;
- graph reachability;
- terminal path existence;
- fallback branches;
- possible infinite loops;
- API failure handling;
- unsupported node configuration;
- accidental secret exposure.

The simulation engine will use a maximum step limit and will never execute real external API calls in the MVP.

## Agentic Development

Codex or another coding agent will be used intentionally for:

- architecture proposals;
- schema generation;
- implementation;
- code review;
- debugging;
- test design;
- regression analysis.

Agent output will be reviewed and validated rather than accepted blindly.

Important prompts, findings, and manual decisions will be recorded in:

docs/agent-log.md

## Trade-offs

- In-memory storage keeps the demo small and easy to run.
- Mock API calls avoid external dependencies and secret handling.
- Swagger UI provides a real interactive prototype without requiring a frontend.
- A constrained node vocabulary keeps the execution engine predictable.
